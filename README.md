# Demo Weather App

### Install & Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Fyresite/SkillsDemo-WeatherPage.git
cd SkillsDemo-WeatherPage
npm install
npm start
```
Thank you for interviewing with Fyresite! We've designed this test to mimic as closely as possible the type of work you'll be doing with us as a React Developer.

Your task is to take this base project, implement the designs and display weather data using the open weather API sample data. There are two pages, one page to collect the zip code and another to display the data. It may not be possible to get the chart to match the design completely using the provided package, so just get it as close as possible. 

At the completion of your 4 hour window please push your changes to your own branch. It's ok if you don't finish, we simply want to see what you can do in the allotted time. 

A few things to note:
1. We have provided an example of a component that works with Redux
2. We want you to use redux to store the relevant data from the api call
3. Use [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/) components when possible, try to avoid unnecessary custom components.

**Assets** for the app can be found in **FyreWeather.zip** located in the root folder.

**Designs** for the app can be found below,

Weather Forecast Page:

Weather data should be retrieved using https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?zip=85001&appid=b182c99605bca11944de3993c970e8f6

We planned to use the API but openweathermap.org recently revoked this route from their free package.

The temperature chart should be generated with this package https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js
