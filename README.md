# Demo Weather App

### Install & Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Fyresite/clutch-web-app.git
cd clutch-web-app
npm install
npm start
```
Thank you for interviewing with Fyresite! We've designed this test to mimic as closely as possible the type of work you'll be doing with us as a React Developer.

Your task is to take this base project, implement the designs and display weather data using an API.

Designs and assets for the app can be found here:
Zip Input Page:

Weather Forecast Page:
https://marvelapp.com/e45b041/screen/68049387/handoff

Weather data should be retrieved using https://openweathermap.org/api/hourly-forecast
using this api key `b182c99605bca11944de3993c970e8f6`

The temperature chart should be generated with this package https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js

Documentation for Material UI can be found here: https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/

A few things to note:
1. We have an example of a component that works off a redux state
2. We want you to use redux to store the relevant data from the api call
3. Use Material UI components when possible, try to avoid unecessary custom components.
