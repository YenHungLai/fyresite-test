# Demo Weather App

### Install & Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Fyresite/clutch-web-app.git
cd clutch-web-app
npm install
npm start
```
A few things to note:
1. We have an example of a component that works off a redux state
2. We want you to use redux to store the data from the api call
3. Use as many Material UI components as possible

Weather data should be retrieved using https://openweathermap.org/api/hourly-forecast
using this api key `b182c99605bca11944de3993c970e8f6`

The temperature chart should be generated with this package https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js
