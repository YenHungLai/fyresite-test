# Demo Weather App

### Install & Run
```
git clone https://github.com/Fyresite/clutch-web-app.git
cd clutch-web-app
npm install
npm start
```
A few things to note:
1. We have an example of a component that works off a redux state
2. We want you to use redux to store the relevant data from the api call
3. Use Material UI components when possible, try to avoid unecessary custom components.

Weather data should be retrieved using https://openweathermap.org/api/hourly-forecast
using this api key `b182c99605bca11944de3993c970e8f6`

The temperature chart should be generated with this package https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js

Documentation for Material UI can be found here: https://material-ui.com/getting-started/usage/
