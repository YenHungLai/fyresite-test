Thank you for interviewing with Fyresite! We've designed this test to mimic as closely as possible the type of work you'll be doing with us as a React Developer.

Your task is to take this base project, implement the designs and display weather data using the open weather API.

At the completion of your 4 hour window please submit a pull request with your completed changes. It's ok if you don't finish, we simply want to see what you can do in the allotted time. 

A few things to note:
1. We have provided an example of a component that works with Redux
2. We want you to use redux to store the relevant data from the api call
3. Use Material UI components when possible, try to avoid unnecessary custom components.

Designs and assets for the app can be found here:

Weather data should be retrieved using https://openweathermap.org/api/hourly-forecast
using this api key `b182c99605bca11944de3993c970e8f6`

The temperature chart should be generated with this package https://www.npmjs.com/package/chart.js
